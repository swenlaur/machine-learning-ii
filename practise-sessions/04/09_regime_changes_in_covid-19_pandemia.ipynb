    "\n",
    "Because of these reasons it is extremely important to know  basic reproduction number $R_0$. It can vary form day to day. We use shorthand $\\alpha_i$ for the basic reproduction number in the $i$-th day.\n",
    "However, due to the similarity with common cold and flu a large number of cases remain undetected. Therefore, a reliable estimate for reproduction number can be estimated only from \n",
